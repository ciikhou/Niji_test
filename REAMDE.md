# **Simple** E2E test suite with Cypress

  :woman_student: :man_student: Want to master Cypress test automation? Our hands-on training at **[BigByte Academy](https://bigbyte.academy)** will guide you step-by-step through the process of writing robust tests and help you gain the confidence to tackle any automation project 

## :goal_net: Goals
- keep it simple - no 'custom' abstractions/functions/utils/helpers (use what Cypress provides)
- tests are easily readable
- project is easily understandable even to people without previous JS or Cypress knowledge
- [use shortcuts](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands#4-Skip-your-UI-as-much-as-possible) to avoid repeating/testing the same UI actions over and over again
